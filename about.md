# About Me

My name is Ben Snape and I'm a Software Developer in London.

Originally a Java SDET, I made the switch to Ruby when I joined [ITV](http://www.itv.com/) (the UK's largest commercial broadcaster) in July 2012.

Since then I've continued to hone my SDET and sysadmin skills whilst helping re-platform ITV's metadata API using Scala microservices in AWS.

You can view my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bsnape), see my (usually football-related) tweets on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bensnape87) and contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=52882842&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile).
