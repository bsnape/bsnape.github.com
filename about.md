# About Me

My name is Ben Snape and I'm a Software Developer in London.

My current role is as a Platform Engineer at [ITV](http://www.itv.com/) (the UK's largest commercial broadcaster) who I joined in July 2012.

I was previously a Ruby SDET for the same company before transitioning across to the world of DevOps in late 2014.

Before that I worked as a Java SDET at [Yell](https://www.yell.com/).

I'm passionate about Open Source and try to contribute back to the community whenever possible.

You can view my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bsnape), see my (usually football-related) tweets on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bensnape87) and contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=52882842&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile).
